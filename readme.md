# 「VisBug」

> Open source web design debug tools

- Point, click & tinker
- Hold shift and **multi-select**
- Edit **any page** in **any state**
- **Hover inspect** styles, accessibility and alignment
- **Nitpick** layouts & content, **in the real end environment**, at any device size
- **Leverage** design tool nudging skills
- **Edit** any text
- **Replace** image(s)
- Traverse DOM like groups & layers in Sketch
- Design **within the chaos** of production or prototypes and the **odd states** they produce
- Bugs become **design opportunities**
- Design **while simulating:** latency, translation, media queries, platform constraints, orientation, screensize, etc
- **Make more decisions** on the front end of your site/app (a11y, responsive, edge cases, etc)


**No waiting** for developers to expose their legos, **just go direct** and edit the end state (regardless of framework) and **execute/test an idea**

<h3 style="font-weight:300; max-width: 40ch;"><b>Give power</b> to designers & content creators power within the web project they have today, <b>by bringing design tool interactions</b> to the browser.</h3>

<br>

Check out the [list of features me and other's are wishing for](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F+feature%22). There's a lot of fun stuff planned or in demand. Cast your vote on a feature, leave some feedback or add clarity. 

Let's do this **design community, I'm looking at you!** Make a GitHub account and start dreamin' in the [issues area!](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug/issues) **Help create the tool you need to do your job better.**


## 🤔 **It's not:**
-   **A competitor** to design authoring tools like Figma, Sketch, XD, etc; **it's a complement!**
-   Something you would use **to start from scratch**
-   A **design system recognizer**, enforcer, enabler, etc.. but it is a **design system leverager!**
-   An **interaction** prototyping tool, you need to produce the states for VisBug to design against
